    add 2 tbs sugar
    add 1 tbs garam masala
    mix to combine
    cook on low until gently bubbling and thickened

Roast the Chicken
    Remove chicken from marinade, shaking off excess
    Broil in a tandoori, if available, or oven, otherwise for 10 minutes, or until almost cooked to 165 degrees int


Combine
    Add chicken to the gravy, and finish cooking until the largest piece of chicken reaches 165 deg int
    Serve with rice.
End

_Notes: Chop and fry instruction is re-used a lot.  Probably would make for a good function.
Roast instruction means two different things in different contexts.  Make sure to differentiate between them if defining them as functions.
Spices should be defined as an array, to reduce repeating
Mix instruction is a basic one that can be repeated as a function
Broiling the chicken should be represented by an if else statement regarding the availability of a tandoor oven
